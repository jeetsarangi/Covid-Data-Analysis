#### To run the code:

Libraries required are:<br>
· Python pandas,numpy,datetime,dateutil,json,openpyxl

Steps to run:<br>
· Dump all the files in one folder <br>
· In ubuntu type ./assign1.sh.<br>
· All the output files will be generated in the same place the whole code will take around 15minutes to run completely.<br>

· `DDW_PCA0000_2011_Indiastatedist.csv`
· `district_wise.csv`
·` districts.csv`
· `mismatch.csv`
· `neighbor-districts.json`
